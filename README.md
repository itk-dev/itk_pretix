# ITK Pretix

This Drupal 8 module creates a new field type that enables a link to
https://pretix.eu/ to be made.

Through the Pretix API it is possible to add, change or remove Pretix
event date entries from the Drupal interface.

1. Add a new field of type `pretix date field type` to an entity.
2. Add a new field of type `pretix event settings` to the entity.
3. Add a pretix connection through the settings (local.settings.php).
4. Watch the magic happen.

## Configuration

Go to `/admin/config/itk_pretix/pretixconfig` and enter your pretix details.

A hidden configuration option, `pretix_event_slug_template`, controls how pretix
event slugs (short forms) are generated. The default value is `!nid` and `!nid`
will be replaced with the actual node id when creating a pretix event.

To change the value of `pretix_event_slug_template`, set it in your site's
settings, e.g. (in `settings.local.php`):

```php
$config['itk_pretix.pretixconfig']['pretix_event_slug_template'] = 'dev-local';
```

If the value of `pretix_event_slug_template` is not empty, but `!nid` does not
occur in the value, `-!nid` will be appended and the final template will be
`dev-local-!nid`.

## Exporters

This module exposes a number of event Data exporters that are run via the pretix
REST api
(cf. [https://docs.pretix.eu/en/latest/api/resources/exporters.html](https://docs.pretix.eu/en/latest/api/resources/exporters.html))

All exporters implement `Drupal\itk_pretix\Exporter\ExporterInterface` (by
extending `Drupal\itk_pretix\Exporter\AbstractExporter`) and are managed by
`Drupal\itk_pretix\Exporter\Manager` which takes care of displaying exporter
parameters forms and running exporters.

The available exporters for a node can be run from
`/itk_pretix/pretix/event/exporters/{node}` where `{node}` is the node id.
